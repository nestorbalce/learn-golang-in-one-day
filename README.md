This one day **workshop** aims to help you learn to be able to **code** in **Go**.

## PLAY.GOLANG.COM

One of the easiest ways to get started with **Go** is by going to https://play.golang.com/

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, playground")
}
```

You can **run** this code by clicking the blue button with “Run” written on it:
